    The PEPA algorithm, implementing TDA is a research task.
    This function identifies a "concept" as any data involving a USER PROVIDES INFO about what to forget.
    
    Params:
        dataset
        faulty_node_idx (int): The index of the sensor node to be "forgotten". Doesn't need to be an int, or a faulty node, USER PROVIDES INFO.
        window_size (int): Number of samples to treat as the forget set (to limit the scope if need).
                           
    Returns:
        forget_indices (list): Indices of samples related to the f_i.
        retain_indices (list): All other indices.
