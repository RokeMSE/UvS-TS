    Implements Self-Contained Temporal Generative Replay (T-GR).

        forget_sample (Tensor): A sample from the Df.
        faulty_node_idx (int): The index of the `node` (gotta recheck about this) to neutralize.
        
    Returns:
        surrogate_sample (Tensor): The neutralized surrogate data.
