# UvS - TS: Unlearning via Surrogation for Time Series Data
## Topic:
- By utilizing the motif(s) detection and data sequence generation, unlearning in Time Series can be achieved via the act of replacing corrupted/unwanted data with generated ones.
- This framework inlcudes:
  + PA-EW (Population-Aware Elastic Weight Consolidation):
  + T_GR (TTemporal Generative Replay):
  + PEPA: A motif detection technique.
  
# TO DO LIST:
1. Load Datasets.
2. Train initial Models.
...

### Core:
1. Implement PEPA.
2. Optimize MMD, FiM calculations.
