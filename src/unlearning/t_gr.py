    Implements Self-Contained Temporal Generative Replay (T-GR) using the 'Reconstruction and Neutralization' strategy

    **This function treats the data of the faulty node as "missing" and uses the model
    itself to impute it, creating a "neutralized" surrogate sample.**

    Params:
        model (nn.Module): The current model being unlearned.
        forget_sample (Tensor): A sample (or batch) from the forget set D_f.
                                Shape: (batch, seq_len, num_nodes).
        faulty_node_idx (int): The index of the node to be treated as missing and reconstructed.
    Returns:
        Tensor: The neutralized surrogate data.
