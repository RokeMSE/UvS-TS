## Integration for `unlearn.py`
- Combine Components: Load the pre-trained model ($θ*$).
- Partition Data: Use your PEPA implementation to get $D_f$ and $D_r$.
- Calculate FIM: Compute the PA-FIM ($F^T$) using $D_r$ and your PA-EWC module.

## Integration for `unlearning_objective.py`
- Implement UvS-TS (Unlearning via Surrogation - Time Series): code the final objective function from the proposal (Eq. 3). This function will:
    + Use T-GR to generate surrogate data for the first term and the pre-calculated FIM for the second penalty term.

- Run Unlearning: Fine-tune the model θ* using the UvS-TS objective to get the final, unlearned model θ.
